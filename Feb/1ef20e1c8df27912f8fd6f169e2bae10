By Mduduzi Malinga  Sport plays a significant role in South African culture as it unites and promotes patriotism, nation-building and social cohesion. Last year, the country celebrated WAFCON winners Banyana Banyana, and this year there presents an opportunity for the country to fly the flag, especially if the nation rallies behind our national teams.  The Springboks have done the country proud several times by winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995, 2007, and 2019.  “Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair.” – Nelson Mandela  This year, our national teams – both men and women – will be representing the country on the World Cup stages. The global showcase started this month with the 2023 Indoor Hockey World Cup in Pretoria, South Africa. The 2023 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup will be held in South Africa, from 10 to 26 February.
